Add method reconnect! 
  if you got CURSOR NOT FOUND error in production using passenger or unicorn you can add following code to your environment.

   # Unicorn clears the START_CTX when a worker is forked, so if we have
   # data in START_CTX then we know we're being preloaded. Unicorn does
   # not provide application-level hooks for executing code after the
   # process has forked, so we reconnect lazily.
   if defined?(Unicorn) && !Unicorn::HttpServer::START_CTX.empty?
     ::Mongoid.reconnect!(false)
   end
   
   # Passenger provides the :starting_worker_process event for executing
   # code after it has forked, so we use that and reconnect immediately.
   if defined?(PhusionPassenger)
     PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
       if forked
         ::Mongoid.reconnect!
       end
     end
   end
